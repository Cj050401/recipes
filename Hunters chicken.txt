Ingrediants:
skinless chicken breasts
4 slices streaky bacon
1 cup grated mozzarella cheese
bbq sauce

Method
-Wrap each breast in a piece of streaky bacon and place in a baking dish/tray.
-Pour the barbecue sauce over the chicken breasts. You can then proceed to cook them immediately or they can be left to 
marinade for an hour or so and this will increase the flavor of the barbecue chicken.
-Cover with foil and cook in a preheated oven 200°C or 400°F for 15 minutes.
-After the 15 minutes are up, remove the foil and baste the chicken breasts with the sauce. 
Then return to the oven for a further ten minutes.
Remove from the oven and sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over each breast. Return to the oven for a few minuted until 
the cheese is melted and bubbling, serve immediately.
